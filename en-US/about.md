The Underhanded Rust Contest is an offical
[Rust Language](https://rust-lang.org) competition to discover and document the
best ways to subtly subvert Rust code. This is intended to be an annual
competition, with a different theme for each year.

This contest is organized by the [Rust Community Team](https://community.rs)
